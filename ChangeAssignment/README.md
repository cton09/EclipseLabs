## Part 1 - Reminder - Input for numbers

Choose the file <code>inputnumbers.py</code> in the text editor to the right.

Thus far, we have talked about how to get input from the user using the <code>input()</code> function. However, this method only works for strings (sequences of letters). If we want to get numbers, we need to use a different method. The preferred method for getting integers and floats from the user is demonstrated in this file.

### As always, to run the file inputnumbers.py go to the terminal and use the following command: 
> $ python inputnumbers.py

{% next %}


## Part 2 - The program
Open the file called **change.py** which will complete the following task

1. The program should take an amount of payment from the user.
2. Based on a total cost of **42.37**, the program should output the amount of change the user should receive.
3. The program should then output the change due in terms of the coins the user should receive

### For example:
```
How much cash are you entering (in dollars)? 100
You will receive $57.63 in change.
57 dollars
2 quarter(s)
1 dime(s)
0 nickels(s)
3 pennies
```
