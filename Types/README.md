# Variable Types

## Types of variables
In python, there are 4 (main) primitive variable types. They are:
    1. string - a string is a sequence of characters wrapped in quotes
    2. int - an int can be positive, negative, or zero, but has no decimal part
    3. float - a float a number with a decimal part
    4. bool - a bool can only be True or False (without quotes)

These variables are shown in the file called <code>variables.py</code>

Before running the code, try to predict what type each of the variables will be.

To run the program, remember to use
> $ python variables.py

{% next %}
