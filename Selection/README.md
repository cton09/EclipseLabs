# Selection/Conditionals Assignment

## Part 1 - Conditionals

Make sure the file <code>select1.py</code> is selected in the text editor to the right.

Just as in life, there are occasions when we will prepare to execute a plan and we must decide whether or not to do so.

The following **selection** statement will allow us to select whether or not to execute a body of code (indented the same depth).

    if(**Boolean expression**): 

* When the **Boolean expression** inside the parentheses is <Code>True</Code> the body of code **will** be executed.

* When the **Boolean expression** inside the parentheses is <Code>False</Code> the body of code **will NOT** be executed.

Example:

    print("Hello and welcome to Eclipse")

### As always, to run the file select1.py, go to the terminal and use the following command: 
> $ python select1.py

{% next %}

## Part 2 - Password Verification
Create a new file called **passwords.py**

Have the user input a password as if they were signing up for an account on a website. Then ask the user to input the same password again to verify.

If the two passwords match, acknowledge and print "account created".

Otherwise, print "verification failed".
