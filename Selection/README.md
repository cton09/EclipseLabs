# Selection/Conditionals Assignment

## Part 1 - Conditionals

Make sure the file <code>select1.py</code> is selected in the text editor to the right.

The following **selection** statement will allow us to select whether or not to execute a body of code (indented the same depth).

    if(**Boolean expression**): 

* When the **Boolean expression** inside the parentheses is <Code>True</Code> the body of code **will** be executed.

* When the **Boolean expression** inside the parentheses is <Code>False</Code> the body of code **will NOT** be executed.

## Part 2 - Temperature

temp.py

Ask the user to type a temperature in Fahrenheit
Print either “it’s nice weather”, or “brrr it’s cold” (or some variation thereof) based on the temperature.

{% next %}

## Part 3 - Schedule

alarm.py

From the user - get two things. A day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a string indicating if we are on vacation. Output a string indicating when the alarm clock should ring. Weekdays, the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". Unless we are on vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".

1. You must create a flowchart which shows how the alarm clock works.
2. Once your flowchart has been approved, you can begin work on creating the code.
