# Selection/Conditionals Assignment

## Part 1 - Asking for numbers

Choose the file <code>inputnumbers.py</code> in the text editor to the right.

Thus far, we have talked about how to get input from the user using the <code>input()</code> function. However, this method only works for strings (sequences of letters). If we want to get numbers, we need to use a different method. The preferred method for getting integers and floats from the user is demonstrated in this file.

### As always, to run the file inputnumbers.py go to the terminal and use the following command: 
> $ python inputnumbers.py

{% next %}

## Part 2 - Conditionals

Make sure the file <code>select1.py</code> is selected in the text editor to the right.

Just as in life, there are occasions when we will prepare to execute a plan and we must decide whether or not to do so.

The following **selection** statement will allow us to select whether or not to execute a body of code (indented the same depth).

    if(**Boolean expression**): 

* When the **Boolean expression** inside the parentheses is <Code>True</Code> the body of code **will** be executed.

* When the **Boolean expression** inside the parentheses is <Code>False</Code> the body of code **will NOT** be executed.

Example:

    print("Hello and welcome to Eclipse")

### As always, to run the file select1.py, go to the terminal and use the following command: 
> $ python select1.py

{% next %}


## Part 3 - Find the max
Create a new file called **find_max.py** which will ask the user for two different numbers and will find the maximum of two numbers.

**This file program does not need to be submitted**


{% next %}

## Part 4 - Temperature

Ask the user to type a temperature in Fahrenheit
Print either “it’s hot out”, “it’s nice weather”, or “brrr it’s cold” (or some variation thereof) based on the temperature.
