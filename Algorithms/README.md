# Algorithms Assignment

## Part 1 - What is an algorithms?

An algorithm is:  *a set of steps to solve a problem*.

Psedocode is:  *steps or instructions written out in english*

For example, if I wanted to make a peanut butter and jelly, one algorithm (in peudocode) could be:

    1 get peanut butter, jelly, and bread out
    2 if the peanut butter and jelly are not open:
    3      open the peanut butter and jelly
    4 get two slices of bread out
    5 use a knife or spoon to spread peanut butter evenly on one side of one of the slices of bread
    6 repeat step 5, using jelly instead of peanut butter, spreading on the other slice of bread
    7 put the slices of bread together so that the peanut butter side and the jelly side are touching each other
    8 done

Note a couple of things about the algorithm:
* Each step is exact (there is nothing ambiguous)
* Each step is specific (it only accomplishes one task)
* The steps are all in a specific order (**sequencing**)

## Part 2 - Example of parts of algorithms:

Open the file <code>pbj.py</code>

Note that pseudocode is always written as comments. Comments always begin with a hashtag symbol.

Let's briefly highlight the parts of this algorithm:

1. Functions - any action words like: <code>open</code>, <code>spread</code>, or <code>put</code> are referred to as *functions* or *methods*.
2. Conditionals - any statements that sometimes happen and sometimes don't, typically with the words <code>if</code> or <code>else</code>.

Which line contains a conditional?

{% spoiler "Answer"%}

Line 2:

    *if* the peanut butter and jelly are not open

{% endspoiler %}

3. Loops - any statements that call for repetition or jumping to a previous step in the code

Which line contains a loop?

{% spoiler "Answer"%}

Line 6:

    *repeat* step 5,

{% endspoiler %}

{% next %}

## Part 3 - Input/Output - revisited

What are the inputs and outputs for the algorithm written in <code>pby.py</code>?

{% spoiler "Inputs"%}

    Peanut butter, jelly, and bread

{% endspoiler %}

{% spoiler "Outputs"%}

    A pb and j sandwich

{% endspoiler %}

Remember to always follow the process:
1. Input
2. Algorithm
3. Output

{% next %}

## Part 4 - Write your own algorithm

Create a new file called gas.py.

Use what you have learned about algorithms to write a set of steps to accomplish the following:

    Compute and display the price a person will pay for gas at the gas station. You have the price per gallon and you can get the number of gallons of gas that were purchased, and whether the person pays cash or credit. If the person pays with a credit card, there is an extra charge of 10% of the total price.

Download this file using the <code>...</code> next to the file name (in the folder).
Upload the file to canvas under the assignment **02 Algorithms.**

### Good Luck!
