# Selection/Conditionals Assignment

## Instructions

The user needs to create a username and a password which will then be used to create an account. The username must be any string between 4 and 12 characters long. 

The password must meet the following criteria:
 - Cannot be the same as the username
 - Cannot be exactly “password”
 - Must be at least 8 characters long
 - At least one other criteria (make up your own)

Given this information, ‘create the account’ by printing out a confirmation message. Any invalid information should not allow an account to be created.
