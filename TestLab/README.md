## Create an algorithm

**The problem is as follows:**

Somebody keeps breaking into the zoo every night and releasing all of the animals! Every morning, when the visitors arrive you have a large group of people and animals all mixed together.  The zoo manager is asking you to write up a detailed process that can be given to any zoo staff member so that they can read the directions and get everyone (all visitors and animals) to their appropriate location. 

The basic directions are that all land animals should be put in a caged area, all animals that live in the water should be put back in the water tank, and all visitors should be sent to a sidewalk that is next to the cage and aquarium.

Write up clear, detailed instructions (in pseudocode) to sort out the land animals, water animals, and visitors to their designated location at the zoo. 

One more thing!  After the staff member finishes sorting, the zoo manager needs to know which group (land, water, sidewalk) had the most animals or people that needed to be moved. 

You can call your file <code>zoo_sort.py</code>
