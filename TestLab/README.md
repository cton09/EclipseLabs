## Create an algorithm

**The problem is as follows:**

You are the owner of a zoo. You had a list of the names of all the land animals, water animals, and employees, but you lost it. 

Your secretary has a backup list of all the names, but they are not sorted into their categories.

So... write an algorithm in pseudocode using the text editor that will put everyone in the correct place. (land, water, or office)

You can call your file <code>zoo_sort.py</code>
